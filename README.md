## Setup 

You can find the requirements in the file __requirements.txt__. All coding files can be found in the __snake__ folder.

## Playing around

We implemented a simple snake envioronment (__snake.py__), simply run 
```
python demo_snake.py
```
to play it yourself !


We also implemented the policy network algorithm as described in our report 

## Going further

The detailed theoretical explanations, the setup parameters and experimental results can be found in the __report__ folder.
